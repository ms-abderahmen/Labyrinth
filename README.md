# Labyrinth

I had the idea to make this simple game when I was doing a project for a C language class. The project consisted of implementing Kruskal's minimum-spanning-tree algorithm to generate a perfect labyrinth.
A perfect labyrinth is a labyrinth (obviously) where there is only one path that connects two different points of the maze.

So after implementing the algorithm in C language for my project, I had the idea of porting the same algorithm in Unity in C# and create a random perfect labyrinth in 3D, and adding the ability to explorer it.
When I had some time between my classes, I grabbed my PC and made this in almost 30 minutes, since I already had the algorithm ready and I only had to do some little changes to make it work in C#.
Then I added a gem that spawns randomly in the labyrinth to actually have somthing to search for the maze and make it look more like a game.
I had some ideas for how to improve it and add levels where you need to collect all the gems, have bigger mazes each level, add some power up and abilities like being able to destroy some walls to make it easier to go through the labyrinth, but I stopped due to my studies and exams.
